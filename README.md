This repository is my personal website to practice on.
It is a static website, and it uses only shoddy images I have taken myself and shody icon images I have designed myself.

For future reference, this was made using jade and sass, as what I believe are preprocessors.

It also used [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp)
